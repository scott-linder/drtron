# drtron #

A very original game written in C and Curses.

## Rationale ##

I've written a few versions of Tron by now in different languages, but this was
the first. At the time my friends were really into Tron.

## I'm Sorry ##

The code is some of my first and I'm afraid to look back at it; it's probably
pretty horrible. I'm putting it into a git repo because I plan to look back
over it and iterate on it.

It's actually relatively fun and has a certain charm to it.
